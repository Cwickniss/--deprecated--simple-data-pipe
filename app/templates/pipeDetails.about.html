    The Simple Data Pipe moves JSON from web services like Salesforce.com and Stripe, and captures it in Cloudant.
    Once persisted in Cloudant, you can do all kinds of different stuff.

    <strong>First time here?</strong> Pause now, and go skim our tutorial on
    <a class="type_link" href="https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe-salesforce-looker/">connecting to Salesforce.com</a>
    before piping your first data. It will provide an overview of the mechanics of The Pipe, even if you don't need visualizations just yet.

    <strong>Start fast:</strong> Choose "Create A New Pipe" and use one of the built-in options found under <span class="type_em">Type</span>. We're always looking to add more. Check our
    <a class="type_link" href="https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe-connectors/">full list of connector options</a> for updates.

    <strong>BYOP:</strong> Build your own pipe with the <a class="type_link" href="https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe-connectors/">JavaScript framework</a>
    we provide. If you build something cool and want to see it become part of a future Simple Data Pipe, let us know. Contributions are always welcome!

    Moving data out of Cloudant is just as easy. The database comes with free, native integrations for loading JSON to data warehousing and analytics engines.
    From there, you're just a step away from the reporting and visualization tools you know and love.

  <p class="type_copy">
    Use the <a class="type_link" href="https://cloudant.com/blog/introducing-data-warehousing-and-analytics-with-cloudant-and-dashdb/">Cloudant-dashDB integration</a>
    to sync data into IBM's cloud data warehouse service. There's the Cloudant-Apache Spark integration for those who want to explore JSON in Jupyter notebooks, or break all the rules by using Spark SQL to query "unstructured" JSON.
    The open-source <a class="type_link" href="https://www.compose.io/articles/transporter-driving-part-one/">Transporter ETL pipeline</a>
    from Compose.io is a great choice for moving between a range of non-relational data stores like MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch â€” all of which are, coincidentally, available on IBM's Compose service.

    Not ready to leave Cloudant just yet? Visualize JSON right from the database by building secondary indexes to organize data that feeds into visualizations in the
