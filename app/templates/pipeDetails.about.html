<h2>Move it in</h2>
<p>
The Simple Data Pipe moves JSON from web services like Salesforce.com and Stripe, and captures it in Cloudant. Once persisted in Cloudant, you can do all kinds of different stuff.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
    <b>First time here?</b> Pause now, and go skim our tutorial on <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe-salesforce-looker/">connecting to Salesforce.com</a> before piping your first data. It will provide an overview of the mechanics of The Pipe, even if you don't need visualizations just yet.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>Start fast:</b> Choose "Create A New Pipe" and use one of the built-in options found under <em>Type</em>. We're always looking to add more. Check our <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe-connectors/">full list of connector options</a> for updates.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b>BYOP:</b> Build your own pipe with the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe-connectors/">JavaScript framework</a> we provide. If you build something cool and want to see it become part of a future Simple Data Pipe, let us know. Contributions are always welcome!

</ul>

<h2>Move it out</h2>
<p>
Moving data out of Cloudant is just as easy. The database comes with free, native integrations for loading JSON to data warehousing and analytics engines. From there, you're just a step away from the reporting and visualization tools you know and love.
</p>

<p>
Use the <a href="https://cloudant.com/blog/introducing-data-warehousing-and-analytics-with-cloudant-and-dashdb/">Cloudant-dashDB integration</a> to sync data into IBM's cloud data warehouse service. There's the Cloudant-Apache Spark integration for those who want to explore JSON in Jupyter notebooks, or break all the rules by using Spark SQL to query "unstructured" JSON. The open-source <a href="https://www.compose.io/articles/transporter-driving-part-one/">Transporter ETL pipeline</a> from Compose.io is a great choice for moving between a range of non-relational data stores like MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch â€” all of which are, coincidentally, available on IBM's Compose service.

Need to go the enterprise route? We have you covered with <a href="https://cloudant.com/dashdb/">IBM's DataWorks</a> data shaping and movement API. It's a paid service, so you'll need to enter credit card info on Bluemix before provisioning.
</p>
<p>
Not ready to leave Cloudant just yet? Visualize JSON right from the database by building secondary indexes to organize data that feeds into visualizations in the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-poseidon3-app/index.html">D3.js library</a>.
